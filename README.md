# Combind CSS Grid and Flexbox Layout Example

I hope that somebody who is learning this stuff, will find this usefull.
In this example I used CSS Grid for layout and grid-template-areas / grid-area. In CSS file you can find in comments grid lines(grid-row/grid-column) if you like to do on that way just comment lines where are grid-template-areas / grid-area, including media queries too. Flex is applied to header content element only, and there is grid inside grid :D Picture gallery is that grid inside grid. I tried to comment, name classes and grid areas on the way that they can be understandable to everyone.
Pictures that I used in this example are from Spain :)
